# Dugga-Elo-Planning-Holo
Nomoskar! You must have plans to visit the famous pujas of Kolkata and spend a memorable time. Along with all the excitement for the pujas you must have started planning for those few days. So many good themes are getting advertised and are being made, its hard to miss out on any of them but alas the choices are so many that it becomes hard to cover the maximum ground without proper planning beforehand and when you finally get down to it, you often find yourselves lost and in a mess.

Our project aims to help you keep your trip and day organized and hassle free by providing you with a roadmap of all the pandals near you and a brief overview on that puja and let you decide whether you want to visit there or not beforehand.

An organized plan along with the routes will help you to focus more on having fun and enjoying your puja. You will get to choose which pandals to visit and will get a pre-planned route where you'll have to face least traffic and move about easily.

Inspiration-----
	Designing an inspiring route for Durga puja plannar involves a harmonious blend of cultural heritage, aesthetic creativity, and meaningful heritage symbolism.
	By drawing frpom the rich tapestry of local history, architecture and mythology, the route can be imbued with a deep sense of reverence and continuity. 
	Integrating elements such as traditional crafts, community narratives, and artistic expression, the route becomes a storytelling canvas that guides attendees through different phases of the the goddess' journey.
	With nods and to natural beauty, interactive experiences, and unity in diversity, the route mirrors a spiritual pilgrimage, culminating in a celebration that resonates on both a personal and collective level, forging lasting memories
	and a profound connection to Durga Puja.
