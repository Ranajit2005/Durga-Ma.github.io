        <p class="durga-puja">
          Durga Puja celebrates the victory of the goddess Durga over the demon king Mahishasura. <br />It begins on the
          same day as Navratri, a nine-night festival in many northern and western states of India(majorly celebrated in
          Bengal and Assam) that more broadly celebrate the divine feminine(shakti).<br /><br />Durga Puja’s first day
          is Mahalaya, which heralds the advent of the goddess (The Devipaksha starts ). Celebrations and worship begins
          on Sasthi, the sixth day. <br /><br />
          The celebrations end with Vijayadashami (“Tenth Day of Victory” ), when, amid loud chants and drumbeats,
          sacred images are carried in huge processions to local rivers, where they are immersed. That custom is
          symbolic of the departure of the deity to her home and to her husband, Shiva, in the Himalayas. Images of the
          goddess—astride a lion, attacking the demon king Mahishasura—are placed at various pandals (elaborately
          decorated bamboo structures and galleries) and temples.
